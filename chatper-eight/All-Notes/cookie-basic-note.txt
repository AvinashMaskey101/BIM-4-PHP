->  A cookie is a small piece of code set by web sever that resides on the client
    machine. Once it's been set, the client automatically returns the cookie to the
    web server with each request that it makes. This allows the server to place
    value it wishes to 'remember' in the cookie, and have access to them when creating
    response.

->  Cookie is a client side data.

->  Cookie is a super global variable and is an associative array type.

   be accessed by another domain.

    a/c number etc.

    to 4KB.

-> Types of cookies:
    a) Session cookies (destroys the user data when the browser is closed)
    b) Persistent cookies (keeps the user data until the expiry date)
