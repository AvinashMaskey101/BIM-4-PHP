        1. Conditional Statements
                a. if
                b. else
                c. else if
                d. switch case

        2. Loop/Iterative Statements
                a. while 
                b. do while
                c. for
                d. foreach (related to array)

        Keywords: break and continue (conditional stmt self controlling)
