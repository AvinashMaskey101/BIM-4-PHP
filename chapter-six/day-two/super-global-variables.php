/* 
Some predefined variables in PHP are "superglobals", which means that they are always
accessible, regardless of scope - and you can access them from any function, 
class or file without having to do anything special.

The PHP superglobal variables are:

$_SERVER
$_REQUEST
$_POST
$_GET
$_FILES
$_COOKIE
$_SESSION
------
$_POST is an associative array of variables passed to the current script via the HTTP POST method when 
using application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data as the HTTP Content-Type in the request. 
You can use when you are sending large data to server or if you have sensitive information like passwords,
credit card details etc.

$_GET is an associative array of variables passed to the current script via the URL parameters. 
you can use when there is small amount of data, it is mostly used in pagination, page number is shown 
in the url and you can easily get the page number from URL using $_GET.

$_REQUEST is a 'superglobal' or automatic global, variable. This simply means that it is available in 
all scopes throughout a script. It is an associative array that by default contains the contents of 
$_GET and $_POST.
