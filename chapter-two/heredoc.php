/* 
   A string literal can be specificed in four different ways:
        -> Single Quote
        -> Double quote
        -> Heredoc
        -> Nowdoc (not in syllabus)
*/

/* 

-> Heredoc provide useful alternatives to defining strings in PHP to the more widely
used quoted string syntax. They are especially useful when we need to define a string that spans
multiple lines (new lines are also interpreted when used in quoted strings) and where use of whitespace
is important.

-> Heredoc text behaves just like a double-quoted string, without the double quotes. This means that 
quotes in a heredoc do not need to be escaped.
